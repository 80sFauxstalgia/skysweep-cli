## [0.5.0] - 2025-09-17

### ‚ú® Added

- **Content Nuke:** Added a `--nuke` feature to bulk-delete content. It supports deleting all posts, media-only posts, text-only posts, or all likes, with a strong confirmation prompt to prevent accidental use.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed

- **Improved Heuristics:** Refactored the bot and marketer detection logic to use a more accurate weighted scoring system. This provides a `confidence score` and detailed `reasons` for each flagged account, improving transparency and reducing false positives.
- **Expanded Heuristics:** Added new detection signals, such as checking for default profile pictures, missing bios, and generic handles with numbers.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-09-17

### ‚ú® Added

- **Goal-Oriented Main Menu:** The CLI now starts with a clear, interactive menu to guide users to primary actions (Scan, Backup, Configure).
- **Media Backup:** Added a `--download-media <path>` feature to download all of a user's posted images.
- **Configuration Flag:** Added a `--configure` flag to explicitly enter the advanced setup questionnaire.
- **Follower Count Note:** The scan results now include a note explaining potential discrepancies between the API follower count and the UI count.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed

- **Major UX Overhaul:** Refactored the entire application flow to be more intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Smarter Login:** Users can now enter just their username; the `.bsky.social` suffix is appended automatically. The prompt has been updated to reflect this.
- **Simplified Configuration:** Removed technical questions about API delays and replaced the confusing "pages" prompt with human-friendly options (Recent, Extended, All).
- **Default Scan:** The default interactive scan now processes all followers to be more intuitive.
- **Project Structure:** Renamed `index.js` to `skysweep.js` for better clarity.

### üêõ Fixed

- **Input Validation:** Menus now validate user input and will re-prompt if an invalid choice is entered.
- **CSV Export:** Corrected a syntax error in a regular expression that was causing the script to crash.
